## 🚀 How to Play

1. *🎛 Device Setup*  
   - The Simon game device consists of *four large buttons, each with a **distinct color* and *unique tone* (e.g., 🔴 Red, 🟢 Green, 🔵 Blue, 🟡 Yellow).

2. *🎬 Starting the Game*  
   - The game begins with *Simon lighting up one of the buttons* and playing its *corresponding tone*.

3. *🔄 Repeating the Sequence*  
   - The player must *press the button* that Simon lit up.

4. *⬆ Increasing Complexity*  
   - If the player *correctly follows the sequence*, Simon will:
     - *Repeat the sequence*  
     - *Add one more step* (another button will light up, and its tone will play).  
     - The player must *repeat the entire sequence in order*.

5. *📈 Game Progression*  
   - The sequence continues to *grow longer and more complex* with each successful repetition.

6. *❌ End of Game*  
   - The game *ends* when the player fails to *reproduce the sequence correctly*.  
   - The goal is to *remember and accurately repeat the longest sequence possible*.
